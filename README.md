This repo contains some problems that i have solved on spoj.com and their solutions.

There are 4 categories of problems :

1.Classical

2.Challenge

3.Tutorial

4.Partial

Most of my solutions are in C language .I am currently using VI editor with gcc in Ubuntu .

Each problem of SPOJ has a unique Problem-Code associated with it .

For each problem ,i have uploaded the following :

1.Source code : ProblemCode.c

2.Problem statement(with occasional self-tips) : ProblemCode.txt

3.Detailed explaination/websites ,etc in ProblemCode.pdf (OPTIONAL)

example :

	If problem-code is DIVSUM then we have to refer 3 files :

	DIVSUM.c

	DIVSUM.txt

	DIVSUM_*.pdf
