24. Small factorials
Problem code: FCTRL2

 You are asked to calculate factorials of some small positive integers.
 Input

 An integer t, 1<=t<=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed by t 
 lines, each containing a single integer n, 1<=n<=100.
 Output

 For each integer n given at input, display a line with the value of n!
 Example
 Sample input:

 4
 1
 2
 5
 3

 Sample output:

 1
 2
 120

 self-note :
 In C language,even if you use unsigned long long int data type , you can get 
 correct factorial only upto 20.Look at the answer as well as codechef pdf for 
 an intelligent algo for overcoming this hurdle using primitive data types only 
 .
